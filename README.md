# Abdal OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS)

The Abdal OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is a set of generic attack detection rules for use with ModSecurity or compatible web application firewalls. The CRS aims to protect web applications from a wide range of attacks, including the OWASP Top Ten, with a minimum of false alerts.

## CRS Resources

Please see the [OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set page](https://modsecurity.org/crs/) to get introduced to the CRS and view resources on installation, configuration, and working with the CRS.
